    <h2>Windows</h2>
	<p><strong>Thermal King windows</strong> are the top-selling insulated replacement windows in the nation. Built for strength, efficiency and durability, our windows are good for you, good for your home, and good for the environment.</p>
	<p>Our patented windows not only save energy dollars, they save you time. Because the strong fiberglass reinforced frame is clad in durable vinyl, there is virtually no maintenance so you’ll never have to scrape and repaint your window frame ever again!
	And the convenient tilt-in feature on the double-hung model makes Thermal King windows easy to clean.</p>

	<h2>Doors</h2>
	<p>Thermal King uses only the very best quality materials to construct its entry door systems. Highly skilled craftsmen assemble hand-beveled glass accented with a variety of unique glass options. Each handmade panel of art glass achieves its personality
	through textural waves and striations, random seeds (air bubbles) and a variety of other natural effects. No two sheets are ever identical. Our goal is to provide the finest quality glass panels available on the market.</p>

	<h2>Siding</h2>
	<p><strong>BEAUTY THAT ENDURES, THANKS TO UNCOMPROMISING QUALITY</strong></p>
	<p>Ever since we introduced the first low-maintenance residential siding in 1947, we’ve been raising the bar on appearance and performance.</p>
	<p>Today, our advanced technology delivers stronger, more rigid siding systems that hug the home tighter, as well as rich, long-lasting colors and subtle textures that capture the authentic look of wood. Trim and accessories are available in a full range
	of styles and complementary colors for a completely custom look.</p>
